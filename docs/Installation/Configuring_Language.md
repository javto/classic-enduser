title: Configuring Language
---
Open the config.ini file found in the folder '{omeka-root}/application/config' in a text editor

Look for the "Localization" section (it's right at the top), and the line in it that reads: `locale.name = "" `

Fill in the two or four letter code for the language you wish to use (see below). This information is case-sensitive and must match exactly.

Omeka is [translated](../Technical/Translate_Omeka) collaboratively using [Transifex](https://www.transifex.com). You can see the progress of available languages by visiting the [Omeka project dashboard on Transifex](https://www.transifex.com/omeka/omeka/); the list displays with the most complete languages at the top. 

## Available languages and codes 
Below are listed the languages in which Omeka is available, along with the two or four letter codes that you will need to configure Omeka to use your language.
